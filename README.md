# Multi-Agent-War-Simulation-Using-Reinforcement-Learning
This code simulates a virtual war between n agents all of whom use RL. Please see the project proposal for domain design and details.
The code is completely written in Python and asks for relevant user input. Please reach out to me @bduggirala2@huskers.unl.edu for any questions. Currently, the code woroks without any bottlenecks if the number of agents is < 6. My future work is to scale it 10+ agents.
